# Exercise Poke

> Design and implement a web application for managing take-away orders in a poke shop. Note that, for
> simplicity, there is no need for handling dates: all orders are placed on the same (unspecified) day.
> The application needs to satisfy the following requirements.
> Poke bowls can be of three different sizes: Regular, Medium, or Large (R, M, L). Each bowl has one base
> and can be ordered by choosing between different amounts of proteins and ingredients, according to
> the bowl size:
> ● Regular bowls include one protein and up to 4 ingredients (minimum 1, optionally repeated).
> ● Medium bowls include two proteins and up to 4 ingredients (minimum 1, optionally repeated).
> ● Large bowls include three proteins and up to 6 ingredients (minimum 1, optionally repeated).
> Specifically users will have these options:
> ● Bases are rice, black rice, salad.
> ● Proteins are tuna, chicken, salmon, tofu.
> ● Ingredients are avocado, ananas, cashew nuts, kale, mango, peppers, corn, wakame, tomatoes,
> carrots, salad.
> An order may contain one or more bowls. Several bowls with the same size, proteins, and ingredients
> can be selected by simply modifying a suitable counter while ordering: for example, it must be possible
> to order 3 R bowls with rice, salmon, avocado and kale without entering the same proteins and
> ingredients three times but just selecting 3 as the number of bowls.
> Every day, the shop can make a maximum number of poke bowls of each size: respectively, 10 R, 8 M, 6
> L. This information must be stored in the database, together with the prices of the poke, detailed later.
> Any user (authenticated or not) can freely browse the availability of the three sizes of poke bowls, as
> well the list of bases, proteins and ingredients that can be used.
> Authenticated users can make their own order by creating a list of poke bowls, specifying their
> characteristics in an interactive configuration page. All the interactions for bowl configuration must be
> handled client-side, except for availability checking of the available sizes, which must be done in real
> time when the order is complete and is being submitted, to avoid letting the user configure a number of
> bowls which are actually not available.
> While the user configures the order, the price is updated in real time at every change (addition/deletion,
> modification of the proteins/ingredients, or the quantity).
> The total price is the sum of the costs of all poke bowls in the order. Each bowl size (R, M, L) has a price
> which is stored in the database: R is 9 €, M is 11 €, L is 14 €.
> Each selected ingredient in excess of the included quantity (i.e., 4 for R and M bowls, 6 for L bowls)
> increases by 20% the initial price of the bowl. A 10% discount on the total of the order is applied if more
> than 4 bowls are included in the order.
> When the user submits the order for processing to the shop, the shop checks that enough poke bowls of
> the requested sizes are still available and confirms the order. Otherwise, a suitable message is shown
> (e.g., “not enough L poke bowls”), and the user is sent back to the configurator to fix their order.
> Authenticated users can always check their list of past orders: the list should show a row for each order.
> The row shows the total number of poke bowls with the total paid price. A detailed view of the order
> must be shown (and hidden) when the row is clicked, and show the same information that was
> presented in the configurator.
> The organization of these specifications in different screens (and possibly on different routes) is left to
> the students.
> Important notes
> ● The price has to be computed on the client side and in real time while users proceed in their
> order. The final price has to be checked server side.
> ● The order should contain an optional text input where users can specify special requests or
> allergies.
